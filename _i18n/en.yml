  about_intro: I became a fanboy of Java since I was 18 and started making mobiles apps with J2ME and web pages with JSP and Servlets for university’s projects. I found my first job at age 19 using different frameworks to work with relational databases, web systems, web services and mobile apps since that moment. I really like android platform, for this reason I change my specialization to the mobile world. Now, I’m 24 and continue to learning C++ to improve my skills on the android platform and Swift to make iOS apps too.
