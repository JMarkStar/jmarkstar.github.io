## A little brief of Gradle

Gradle is a open source tool to automate your project building; in other words it compiles your code, packs it on a executable(`*.jar`, `*.apk`, etc) and finally runs unit tests, all of these with only one command like this `./gradlew clean build`.

Th good thing about this is you can create your own `plugins` and `tasks` for adding them to the execution or execute them individually

## Gradle is single project and multiprojects
